This is a true random number generator that does not require external input for initial conditions.

This algorithm was implemented by running a same paragraph of code and count the time cost by running it.

Because even the time it takes for the same computer to run the same piece of code is not the same, and the degree of disparity depends on multiple factors, which creates a chaotic system from which we get randomness.
